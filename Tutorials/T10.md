### **Tutorial 10: App Data Storage (Part 2)**

#### 1. What are the advantages of using Room Persistence Library to communicate with local databases over using SQLite API Packages directly?

While Room is actually built on top of SQLite, it offers QoL improvements that make development much safer:
- Compile-time Verification: If you write a type in a raw SQLite query, your app crashes at runtime. With Room, the compiler checks SQL at build time and will throw an error before running the app.
- Boilerplate Reduction: SQLite requires a lot of manual labor (e.g. writing `ContentValues`, opening/closing connections, and manually mapping cursor rows to Java/Kotlin objects). Room handles this automatically.
- Architecture Integration: Room is designed to work with LiveData and Flow, making it easy to update UI automatically whenever the data in the database changes.



#### 2. Briefly explain the three components in Room Database.

Room consists of three major components that work together to manage the database lifecycle:

#### a. Database class

The Database class is the main access point for the connection to the app's persisted data.
It must be an abstract class that extend `RoomDatabase`. It serves as the container for the DAOs and define 
which Entities belong to the database version.


#### b. Data Access Object

The DAO is the component that contains the methods used for accessing
the database. It is an interface annotated with `@Dao`. Instead of writing
database logic in the activities, methods are called from the DAO. It is responsible for defining the data
interaction (Insert, Update, Delete, and Queries).

#### c. Data Entity

An Entity represents a table within the database. It is a class annotated with
`@Entity`. Each instance of this class corresponds to a row in the table, and each field corresponds to a column.
It must include a Primary Key to uniquely identify the data.

#### 3. Identify the differences between the Query Method and the Convenience Method in Data Access Objects.

In a Data Access Object (DAO), methods are catagorized based on how much manual SQL is required:

| **Convenience Methods**                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Query Methods**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Methods annotated with `@Insert`, `@Update`, or `@Delete`. No SQL Code is required; Room handles the generation of the SQL necessary to add, modify, or remove rows based on the objects passed into the function. | Methods annotated with `@Query`. Writing custom SQL code is required (e.g. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >18`). This is used for reading data or performing complex operations like joins and filtering that Convenience Methods cannot handle. |

#### 4. Other than storing data in local storage (including internal and external local storage), we can also use cloud storage to store our application data. Provide one example of a scenario where cloud storage is a better option than local storage.

Cloud Storage (such as Firebase Firestore or AWS Amplify) is a better option than local storage when data availability across multiple devices is required.

Consider a Collaborative Task Management APp (e.g. Trello or shared family calendar). If the data
were stored only in the device's Local Storage, a task added by one user would only
exist on their specific phone. By using Cloud Storage, the task is uploaded to a remote server and then 
synced to all other invited users' devices in real-time. This ensures that even if a user loses their phone, their data is not lost 
and can be accessed from any other device upon logging in.
