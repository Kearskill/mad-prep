**Tutorial 5: ViewGroup**

1. In your opinion, which viewgroup(layout) is more..  
   a. Flexible?  
   b. Easy (shorter development time)?  
   c. Adaptive / Dynamic?

Provide ONE(1) justification for each of your answers in (a) to (c) above.

`a. Constraint layout is the most flexible, the elements have relative relationships 
between them, making it adaptable to different screen sizes.`

`b. Linear layout, the views are arranged strictly horizontally or vertically.`

`c. Constraint layout, the flat hierarchy allow it to adjust the size and position of 
its children based on available space.`   

2. Choose any THREE (3) viewgroup discussed in Lecture 4, and provide TWO (2)
   advantages and TWO (2) disadvantages for each of the viewgroup.


| **ViewGroup**               | **Advantages**                         | **Weaknesses**                                                                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Constraints Layout**      | Flat view                              | Steep learning curve                                                          |
|                             | Highly flexible and adaptive           | Requires careful management of many constraint definitions                    |
|                             |                                        |                                                                               |
| **Linear Layout**           | Very simple and intuitive              | Making complex UI requires deep nesting (less performance)                    |
|                             |                                        | Less flexible for responsible design across different screen sizes            |
|                             |                                        |                                                                               |
| **Relative Layout**         | Position views relative to one another | Complexity of relationships might make the XML file hard to read and maintain |
|                             | Good for overlapping elements          |                                                                               |

3. Debate over the use of nested layout in your mobile app UI.

Advantages:
- Nested layout make design easier to organize
- Improve readability of the layout file

Disadvantages:
- Too many nested layout reduces performance, the system require
more time to render
- UI is harder to maintain due to the complexity of the program


4. The navigation chart is a diagram that we used to illustrate the activity flows in the
   mobile application. For example, activity A to activity B, activity B to activity C and
   D, etc. The purpose of having a navigation chart is to ensure the following:
   (1) To prepare for the navigation methods (is it using a button? Navigation drawer?
   Navigation bar? Or others?)
   (2) To create a seamless browsing experience for the user (the navigation from one
   activity to another should be logical)
   (3) To ensure that there is no dead / isolated activity (viz., unreachable activity).
   Let’s draw a navigation chart by using UMTouch as our reference subject. The full
   navigation chart for UMTouch is very complex because it contains many activities.
   Hence, for your navigation chart, you only need to draw up to 10 activities with a
   minimum of 3 navigation levels.
   Tips: Refer to the slides in the lecture notes (Lecture 4, Slides 25-29) to see the examples
   of the navigation chart. Note that, the navigation chart can be of different formats (e.g.,
   different color, different arrow, use UI draft instead of the activity name), and you can
   use any tools such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Lucid chart, pen-pencil, etc. to
   draw it.
