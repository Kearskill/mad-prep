**Tutorial 06: Fragments and Navigation**

1. Briefly explain the following terms:   
a. Fragment  
`Fragment offers modularity for activities (basically like a method in Java), and can be used to make different pages. It is always attached to an activity.`

b. Fragment Manager  
`Fragment Manager is the class responsible for performing actions on an app fragment.`

c. Fragment Transaction  
`Fragment Transaction is a set of Fragment operations such as add, remove, replace, attach, detach. Transactions are used to change the state of the Fragment UI, and often added to the Activity’s back stack.`

d. Fragment Lifecycle  
`Fragment Lifecycle is the lifecycle of each instance of fragment. The commands include onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy().`

2. State the similarity and difference between Activity and Fragment.

Similarity: Have a lifecycle and manages user interface.

Differences:  
- Activity: Independent component, main entry point to a mobile app.
- Fragment: Dependent on activity, must be hosted within an activity.

3. Explain TWO (2) benefits of using Fragment in a mobile application.

`Modularity and reusability, fragment can be used to develop a specific UI (e.g. the top bar) and can be reused on most activity.`

`Support for difference screen sizes. E.g. on a phone, 2 components might be shown on separate activities, but on a tablet, the 2 components might be shown side by side (2 fragment in one activity).`

4. Smooth navigation is important to user experience.  
Do you agree with the statement above? Justify your agreement.

`Yes, mobile app developers should thrive for quality of life and user experience, by making the app more friendly and intuitive. To achieve that, we need to maintain a smooth navigation, and have the app to be more fast, predictable, and without unexpected crashes or freezes.`

5. What are the two ways that fragments can communicate with each other?  
`Shared activity` and `Shared viewmodel`

6. Why is it not recommended for fragments to communicate directly with each other?

`It will cause tight coupling and make the fragments very dependent on each other. This will limit the reusability and modularity of fragments, resulting in higher cost for maintenance and testing.`
