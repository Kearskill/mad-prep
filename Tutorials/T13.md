**Tutorial 13: Permission**


1\. Using your own words, explain the purpose of declaring/requesting permission in a mobile application.

The core purpose of declaring and requesting permissions is **User Privacy and System Integrity.**

- Transparency: It informs the user exactly what parts of their digital life (contacts, location, photos) or physical device (camera, microphone) the app wants to access.

- Consent: It ensures the user remains in control. An app cannot simply spy on a user's location without an explicit agreement.

- Security: By restricting access by default, the operating system prevents malicious apps from 
performing harmful actions, such as sending expensive SMS messages or wiping storage without authorization.

2\. Differentiate between install time permission and run time permission

| Feature        | Install-Time Permissions                                                    | Run-Time Permissions                                                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| When requested | Granted automatically when the app is installed from the store              | Requested while the app is running, specifically when the feature is needed |
|                | The user agrees by choosing to install the app. No popup appears during use | A system dialog pops up asking the user to allow or deny                    |
| Risk Level     | Low                                                                         | High                                                                        |
| Revocation     | Harder to revoke, usually requires uninstalling or deep system settings     | Can be toggled on or off by the user in settings at any time                |


3\. How do we decide whether a permission request is required for a mobile application?  
Explain. 

To decide whether a permission request is required, we need to seek the balance between functionality and user trust.

| Criteria | Test                | Question                                                | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A        | Core Functionality  | Does the app need this to perform its primary job?      | A navigation app must have Location permission, but a calculator app does not need Location permissions.                                                                                                                                                     |
| B        | Privacy Alternative | Is there a way to achive the goal without a permission? | Instead of asking for "Full Storage" permission to let a user pick a profile picture, you can use a System Picker. The system handles the file selection and only gives your app accesss to that one specific file, requiring zero permissions from the user | 
| C        | User Benefit        | Will the user understand why you are asking?            | If you ask for Microphone access in a photo gallery app, the user will likely become suspicious and uninstall the app. Every permission should have a clear, logical link to a feature the user is currently trying to use.                                  |
| D        | System Requirements | Can the OS run without the permission?                  | In older versions of Android, scanning for Bluetooth devices required Location permission because a Bluetooth scan could technically be used to triangulate a user's position.                                                                               |
