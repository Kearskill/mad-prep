1. Using your own words, explain the importance of the sandbox mechanism in the Android System.

`Sandbox mechanism is the security mechanism to run various running program separately. Without sandbox, applications can easily access all users data and system resources such as microphone access, and camera access. With a sandbox, we can partition the app so that it only interferes with the allocated data and resources granted to it.  `

2. State the six main callback methods in an activity lifecycle. What is the use of these main callback methods?

```text
The 6 main callback methods are onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(),
onStop(), onDestroy(). The android system calls these method sequentially as
activity transitions, allowing us to manage activities resources, UI and 
state. 

onCreate() – object is created 

onStart() – called just before activity becomes visible to user 

onResume() – called when app interacts with the user 

onPause() – called when users are away from keyboard 

onStop() – called when activity finished, new application cover the screen 

onDestroy() – called before activity is destroyed 
```
