Place: Dewan 2 Aras 1 Bangunan Peperiksaan<br>
mcq with only one correct answer<br>
bring 2b pencil twin

- 40 mcq
- 1 scenario-based analytical question
- 1 coding question

### Part A (20 marks)
40 mcq<br>
topics after online test (after app bar and navigation)<br>

so the topics are:
- Accessibility of User Interface
- Data Storage
- Location
- Sound and Audio
- Permissions

one correct answer per question

marks deduction mechanism not applied

### Part B (30 marks)

1 scenario based question (10 marks)<br>
1 coding question (20 marks)

### Multiple Choice Questions
- Factual questions
- Correct/Incorrect statements
- Application & decision making/justification

e.g.<br>
- Select the class responsible for dispatching information about user interface interactions (such as clicking a button or changing window focus) to the system's accessibility services.
- What is the approximate accuracy of Fine Location service?
- Select the most appropriate data storage type for a given application
- Application of Material 3 Accessibility Principles in a given scenario
- Transition of MediaPlayer states following a sequence of actions
- Dealing with Android permissions for a specific usage


### Scenario Based Question

Just KBAT question twin

e.g.<br>
Given a set of rough user requirements for designing an application:
- Decide app features with justifications
- Apply relevant guidelines/principles for designing the app

### Programming Question

Use Java twin

To interpret incomplete code based on requirements
and correctly complete the code and propose
enhancements to improve the app's usability

e.g.<br>
Decide appropriate layout and views/widgets for the activity XML file
<br>

Write Java code to implement the activity:
- Bind code to views (button, spinner ...)
- Read and process data sent between activities
- Make your app more usable (usability)

## Alleged tips
- Got Unidirectional Data Flow (3 way stupid android data)
- Intent to transfer data (8 marks)
