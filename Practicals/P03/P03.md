**Practical 3: The Profile Page – UI Implementation**


## Preparation

Open your “My First Application” project that you created in Week 1.


Refer to the Individual Profile Page that you designed in Week 2.



*Take note that depending on the version of Android Studio and theme that you are using, the user interface you are seeing might be different.



**Implement Profile Page using Constraint Layout**



### Step 1: Click on the res/layout/activity_main.xml file and your Android Studio should be in design mode now as follows:

### Step 2: Ensure that your layout is “ConstraintLayout” by checking the Component Tree Panel. Otherwise, right-click on the layout, and choose “Convert View” to convert the current view to “ConstraintLayout”. (Alternatively, you may switch to Code view to examine the layout of activity_main.xml.)

### Step 3: Realize your UI draft of your Profile Page by drag-and-drop relevant UI widgets onto the activity_main.xml.

By using simple UI widgets from the Palette Panel, such as TextView, ImageView, etc., you should be able to implement your UI layout.



Note: TextView is a UI container to place text while ImageView is a UI container to put your image.



Tips: You can search for relevant images online, download the images, and drag-and-drop them into the res/drawable folder (switch to the Resource Manager tab on the left panel). When you are drag-and-dropping the ImageView to your XML canvas, you should be able to select the images that you pasted to your res/drawable folder to decorate your UI layout (by setting the src attribute of ImageView).






### Step 4: A good practice when using ConstraintLayout is to rename your UI widget into a proper name.

Click on each UI widget, find id in the Attribute Panel, then give a name to the UI widget.

You will be prompted to confirm refactoring (viz., in this case, to rename) the UI widget, click “Refactor” to confirm this action.

### Step 5: Now, try running your mobile app in the emulator, what can you see?

All UI widgets will be relocated to (0, 0) coordinate (Top-Left Corner) because no constraints are set for these UI widgets. See the red error icon beside the UI widgets in the Component Tree Panel. If you click on the red error icon, you will see the following error message:

### Step 6: For constraint layout, it structures the UI widgets in the layout by setting constraints between the UI widgets and/or with the parent layout. Each UI widget needs to have at least ONE horizontal constraint and ONE vertical constraint to ensure proper alignment during runtime.



When you click on the UI widget, you will see 4 empty circles surrounding the widget. Horizontal constraints refer to the left and right empty circles, while vertical constraints refer to the top and bottom empty circles.

To add the constraint, you can drag the constraint arrow from the selected empty circle.

Or you can also use the Attribute Panel > Layout Sub-Panel to create constraint.

Step 7: When everything is aligned, run your mobile app again. All UI widgets should be in the correct arrangement now (the red error icons will also disappear once all UI widgets are having at least ONE horizontal constraint and ONE vertical constraint).
