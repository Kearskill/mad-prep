**Practical 2: The Profile Page**

## Task 1: Preparation
Form a team (or you can use your assignment grouping).
Choose ONE (1) Application from Google Play Store or Apple App Store (preferably your
favorite application)


## Task 2: Analyze and Draft

a. Using your own words, briefly introduce the mobile application.

b. By using three keywords, discuss and describe your main impression of the UI design of
this mobile application.
• For example: minimalist, fun, peaceful, natural, professional, etc.

c. Find out the target user of the mobile application. (The target user can be more than one,
e.g., elderly, children, working adults, young gamers.)

d. Let’s assume that your group is the developer team that develops this mobile application.
To appreciate the team’s efforts, your team leader proposes to credit everyone by putting
everyone’s profile in the last section.
